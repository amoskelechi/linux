You work as the IT staff in a company, a new intern Sam started today.You received an email from HR to create Sam in the system with all the necessary credentials.
Create user Sam
Give Sam password Sam#123
Create group interns
Add Sam to the interns group 
Grant group interns read only priviledges to the /tmp folder your created in Day4
NB: Kindly outline the steps you took to finish this task.


                        Solution:
    I used the command sudo useradd -m Sam to add the user Sam, and then the system demanded for my password which I entered.
I then ran the command cat /etc/passwd | grep Sam to confirm that the user Sam was created.
I then ran the command sudo passwd Sam to prompt me to create the Password for the intern Sam, and then I entered Sam#123
I pressed enter and I was prompted to re-enter the password again which I did.
I then created the interns group using the command "sudo groupadd interns"
I confirmed the group was created by running the command "cat /etc/group | grep interns"
I added Sam to the group interns using the command "sudo usermod -aG interns Sam", the use of -aG here is to ensure he is not removed from any other group
I confirmed that Sam was added to the group using the command "groups Sam"
Because I created temp folder instead of tmp on Day4, I used the command mv temp tmp to rename it to tmp 
While I was still in my linux directory that contains the tmp folder:
I ran the command sudo chown :interns tmp to change ownership of the the temp folder to interns
I used sudo chmod 750 tmp to grant read only permission to the group interns
I used ls -ld tmp to confirm tha the read only permission was granted to interns group
I used git status to check the status of Day5 file
I used git add . command to stage Day5 file and tmp folder since I renamed it from temp to tmp
I used git commit -m "Assignment Day5 details" to commit the file
I then used the command git push to push the file to my github repo
